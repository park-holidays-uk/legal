**WHAT ARE COOKIES?**

Cookies and similar technologies **“Cookies”** are small data files which are placed on your smart phone, tablet, laptop, or other device when you use websites and/or apps. They are used to remember when a device returns to a site, to track a user, or to identify where someone has come from another site.

Our websites and apps use other technologies, similar to Cookies, which also store or provide access to information stored in your devices including, but not limited to web beacons, pixels, plug ins, APIs, fingerprinting technologies, and object storage. For the purposes of this Notice, we use the term “Cookies” to include all technology that stores or accesses information on a user’s device, all of which are governed by the same legal rules.

**FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES**

First-party cookies on our websites are those set by our web servers, or any JavaScript loaded on our websites. In the case of apps, the Software Development Kits (**“SDKS”**) utilised by us.

In addition to the first-party cookies we set ourselves, we make use of Cookies from carefully selected third- parties; primarily for analytical, tracking, and digital marketing purposes. Data may be transferred to those third-parties as part of the deployment of cookies by them.

When you first visit any of our websites or apps, we will ask for your consent to place Cookies or other similar technologies on your device in all cases where they are not **strictly necessary** to provide you with a service that you have requested (e.g., to enable you request a brochure, book a holiday or arrange a park visit etc.).
