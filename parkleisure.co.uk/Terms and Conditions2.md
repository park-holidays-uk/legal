No refunds will be issued in these circumstances. If, in the reasonable opinion of the management of the park, we believe that you or a member of your party may not comply with the above, on entry to the park, we reserve the right to refuse entry or not to hand over accommodation to any person or groups of persons at our discretion. In such cases a full refund will be issued to the lead name on the booking.

 All children must be properly supervised by parents or guardians throughout your holiday, including all park organised activities. We reserve the right to deny access to our facilities and/or any children’s activities if, in the reasonable opinion of the management of the park, we believe that any child or children will be unduly disruptive.

 Park Leisure will not tolerate physical or verbal abuse towards its staff. We have a zero tolerance policy and you will be asked to leave the park and/or accommodation immediately. In these cases no refund will be offered.

12. **Number of your party**
 The total number in your party (including children and babies) must not exceed the maximum capacity of the accommodation as advertised. In most cases this will be no more than six or eight depending on the size of the accommodation concerned. In the event that these numbers are exceeded, we reserve the right to exclude or refuse entry to any or all members of your party from the holiday park. Where half or more of the party is aged between 17 and 25, you must tell us when you book. We have the right to refuse your booking or cancel after bookings have been checked and/or we reserve the right to refuse entry or not to hand over accommodation to any person or groups of persons at our discretion.

All adults booked must appear on the electoral roll at the address given when booking or provide evidence of their permanent address such as a utility bill if requested. Commercial vehicles will not be permitted to enter our holiday parks. You must bring ID with you as you may be asked for this on arrival or during your stay.

16. **Groups**
 Family and friends who live at the same address or know each other or who travel together will be considered as making a group booking even if they have made separate bookings. Group bookings (whether made by 1 person or a number of people) of 5 or more holiday homes or pitches must be made through our **Allocations Team by calling** [**0343 178 7080**](tel:0343-178-7080). If this is not done, we will cancel any bookings that are part of a group booking. In this instance a full refund will be given. The lead booker for a group is responsible for the conduct of the other members of the group and for ensuring they comply with these terms and conditions. We may require the lead booker to provide a deposit as security in the event of any damage by any member of the group.

17. **Guests with specific needs** 
 Many of our holiday homes offer specific accommodation suitable for holidaymakers with wheelchairs or who may have mobility difficulties. However certain accommodation and locations may not be suitable. If your party includes someone with specific requirements please let us know at the time of booking.

18. **Allergies**
 If any member of your party has an allergy to pets we would strongly recommend that you do not book accommodation which accepts pets. We cannot guarantee that pets have never occupied any of our accommodation.

 Most dogs are welcome at our parks and in specific accommodations with a maximum of two dogs per booking. Some breeds of dog including those listed in the **Dangerous Dog Act 1991** are not allowed. Please provide us with the details of the breed of your dog when you book with us. Other pets may be permitted at the discretion of the Park General Manager, please check when booking. There is a charge of £40 per week and £25 per short break per pet. Assistance dogs are exempt from these requirements and charges. Pets must be kept on a lead at all times and you must clean up after your pet. Pets (other than assistance dogs) are not allowed in any of our park facilities unless otherwise stated or play areas. Pets should not be left unattended in holiday homes or elsewhere on the park and must not be allowed on bedding or seating. If we reasonably believe your pet is causing a nuisance on the holiday park or causing damage to the holiday home you will be required to remove it from the park and/or we reserve the right to refuse entry.
If you bring a pet to stay in an accommodation that has not been graded as pet friendly, you will be charged £60 for it to be specially cleaned.

21. **Special requests**
 We will do our best to meet any special requests; however, we are unable to guarantee the fulfilment of these requests. Special requests do not form part of the booking contract and are not a condition of booking.

22. **Use of your holiday home**
 You are required to take good care of your holiday accommodation whilst you occupy it. At the end of your holiday you must leave your holiday accommodation undamaged, thoroughly cleaned and tidy and free of all rubbish which must have been placed in the bins on the parks. By booking with us you agree that we have reserved the right to recover from you any costs or fees incurred by us for damage to any of our property caused by you or any member of your party. We may either, at our sole discretion, request the immediate payment of our reasonable costs during your stay, or charge the payment card details provided at the time of booking, or instruct a 3rd party to contact you after your stay to recover our reasonable costs. The reasonable costs we may incur if you damage our holiday accommodation are likely to include additional cleaning costs, costs for repair or replacement of anything damaged by you or any member of your party and may include a daily charge for any period the holiday accommodation is unusable due to damage. Should we be unable to process a payment against the payment card used to confirm your stay we will take legal action to recover the cost of damage sustained during your occupation. If you request we will send a breakdown of these costs to the address used for the booking. We reserve the right to enter your accommodation, at any reasonable time during your stay, in order to inspect the condition of the accommodation or without notice in the event of emergency.

23. **Your personal possessions**
 The Company does not accept any responsibility for the theft or loss of your personal possessions whilst on our parks or whilst you are in your holiday home and you should take appropriate security measures to ensure against theft and or loss.

24. **Availability of facilities**
 For health and safety reasons some of our facilities and activities have age and/or height restrictions. Please check these with us when you book. In our swimming pools, children under the age of 12 must be accompanied by an adult. All children under the age of 8 and all non-swimmers must be accompanied in the water by a competent adult and kept within arm’s length at all times. At busy times access to facilities may be restricted for health and safety reasons. We may operate session swims in our pools during periods of high demand. Occasionally we need to close or withdraw certain facilities (e.g. for safety, maintenance or other reasons beyond our control), in this case no refund or compensation will be offered.

25. **Entertainment**
 The company will endeavour to provide the entertainment as advertised on our website and in your welcome brochure; however, at selected parks and during certain periods of the year, entertainment may be limited to weekends only. We reserve the right to alter or withdraw any facilities or programmed entertainment without prior notice.

26. **Your car**
 You should comply with speed limits, parking and other traffic regulations on our parks. All vehicles are brought onto the holiday park at their owners risk and the Company does not accept responsibility for loss or damage to these except where it is caused by our negligence or fault. Our Parks are not currently designed to supply the electricity required to support vehicle charging. In addition to the additional load on the accommodation’s supply, there is an increased risk of electric shock and a trip hazard from any charging cables that would be in use. Although we are fully committed to doing our bit for the environment and welcome hybrid cars, we therefore have to insist that guests do not use the accommodation’s electricity supply to charge their vehicle.

27. **Marketing accuracy**
 Whilst every care is taken to ensure that the details on our website are correct at the time of being published, the images shown are for illustration purposes only and the details may be subject to alteration from one park to another. The photography on our website is to be used as a guide and some might not be of the park itself. The ‘Out and About’ sections contain options for off-park entertainment. Please check with the operators for relevant opening times.

28. **TV filming and photography**
 Due to the increasing popularity of Park Leisure holidays, we receive requests from TV and other companies to film or photograph on our parks. We also undertake our own promotional filming & photography. Every effort is made to ensure filming does not intrude into or affect any holiday activity and that it is clear to guests that filming/photography is taking place. We will not accept responsibility if, contrary to your wishes, you appear on film or in photographs and we are unable to make any financial award or payment of any kind.

29. **Data Protection**
 The information you give us in connection with your booking is held securely on our computer system and dealt with in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018. By providing us with this information you are deemed to accept this and to have the consent of all members of your party to this. We keep this information to help us improve our service to you and to provide you with information about our holidays and services by telephone, e-mail, post and SMS and to keep you informed of our latest news and offers. If you would prefer not to receive this information from Park Leisure then please contact us at **Park Leisure Limited,** **Glovers House, Glovers End, Bexhill, East Sussex, TN39 5ES**. Further details relating to our [privacy policy](https://www.parkleisure.co.uk/privacy-policy) can be found on our website.

30. **Gambling Restrictions**
 Any guest included in the booking that has self-excluded themselves from any other gambling premises must make themselves known to the management of the park, on arrival at the commencement of their stay. The Company will not accept any liability for any loss incurred by any guest who has self-excluded themselves from any other gambling establishment when they continue to gamble on park.

31. **Park Environment**
 Some of our holiday parks have open water sources such as ponds, rivers, lakes or dykes. Please ensure you familiarise yourself with the park layout and supervise children and vulnerable adults appropriately. Our holiday parks are often located in rural areas, which may restrict lighting levels. Please take care to avoid accidents and consider using a torch if you are in any way uncertain about the lighting conditions in place. Please also take extra care on uneven ground and paths.

32. **Hot Tubs**
 If you have booked accommodation that included a hot tub it will have been completely emptied, cleaned and refilled on the day of your arrival in order for us to maintain the required hygiene standards. Given the quantity of water involved, it may not be at the regular running temperature of between 37°C and 38°C until the evening of your arrival. For your health and safety reasons, we test your hot tub’s chemical and water quality twice a day and have to insist when using your Hot Tub you: Supervise all children between the ages of 5 and 16 years. No child under 5 years should use the Tub.
