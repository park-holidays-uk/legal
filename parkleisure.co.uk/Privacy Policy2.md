In the event that our business is acquired, either wholly or partly, by another business (e.g. a merger or sale) we may need to disclose your personal information to that company in order for them to continue providing services to you. Should this occur, your data will only be used by that company for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice.

Your personal information may also be shared with another company, during preliminary discussions around a merger or acquisition of our business, prior to entering a contract. In this event, the data will be shared securely and kept confidential and deleted if the merger or acquisition does not complete.

**International data transfers**

In order to deliver our services and products to you, we sometimes need to transfer your information outside of the UK or European Economic Area (EEA) to countries which have different data protection rules.

Where this is necessary, we ensure the transfer is secure and will be compliant with prevailing laws and regulation. Our standard practice is to use standard contract clauses (SCC’s) which have been approved by the European Commission and the relevant UK authorities. These clauses can be viewed [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

Where we share data with our US-based parent company, we rely on our Inter Group Agreement, which incorporates the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

**6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

<p id="HOW-WE-PROTECT-YOUR-INFORMATION">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to only those employees, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach, where we are legally required to do so.

Examples of the measures we take to protect your data include:

- Encryption of data
- Security measures that protect and monitor our IT systems to protect from external attack and unauthorised access
- Regular penetration testing of our systems
- Information security assessments of third parties we share your data with
- Internal policies and regular staff training relating to data protection

**Measures you can take to protect your data**

We will never ask you to confirm your bank or credit card details via email or text. If you receive such a request, please ignore it, and do not respond.

When accessing your account in a public location, we recommend you log out and close your browser when you have finished.

We recommend that you keep your account and password details private and do not share them. It is also recommended that when setting passwords, you use at least 8 characters and a mixture of letters and numbers. You should make your password hard to guess, not use the same password for different online accounts and consider changing it regularly.

**7. YOUR RIGHTS**

<p id="YOUR-RIGHTS">You have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information:</p>

**Right to be informed** in a clear and concise way about how we process your personal information. This is referred to as privacy information and we rely on this Privacy Notice to meet this requirement.

**Right of access** to your personal information (commonly known as a "Data Subject Access Request", “DSAR” or “SAR”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

We are committed to providing the information you request as part of your Data Subject Access Request and have procedures in place to ensure this occurs in a timely fashion.

**Right to rectification** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**Right to erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Right to restrict processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:

- If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
- Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
- Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
- You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Right to data portability** of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Right to object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate reasons to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Right related to automated decision making and profiling** based on the personal information we hold about you. Where we do this, you have the right to be informed of the processing and to request human intervention. Where we rely on this type of processing, we will carry out regular checks to ensure our systems are working as intended.

**Right to withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Please note we do not have agreements in place with any third-party platforms that offer “Data Subject Rights Requests as a Service.” As a responsible controller of your personal information, we recognise doing so would present significant risks. The rights afforded to you do not obligate us to interact with third parties. We will however endeavour to action requests received from third parties. Following receipt of a request we will continue our interactions with the you (or the requestor themselves) directly.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at **<dpo@parkholidays.com>**.

**Time limit to respond**

We endeavour to respond to all legitimate requests within the required one calendar month timeframe. If your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, we may need to extend the response window by up to a further two calendar months. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
