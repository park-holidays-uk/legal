Data protection is a particularly high priority for Park Holidays UK. When we process our data subjects or site visitor personal data, we ensure it will always be consistent with the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 in the UK. By means of this Privacy Policy and data protection declaration, Park Holidays UK would like to inform our data subject of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, process and share. Furthermore, our data subjects are informed, by means of this policy of the rights to which they are entitled.

Park Holidays UK has implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website and other channels. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

**1. Definitions**

  The data protection declaration of Park Holidays UK is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for everyone including our data subject and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terminology used.

  *In this data protection declaration, we use the following terms:*

  **1.1 Consent**
  Consent by the data subject is freely given, specific, informed and an unambiguous indication of their wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of their personal data.

  **1.2 Controller responsible for the processing**
  The Controller responsible for the processing is Park Holidays UK, which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are governed by the European Union or UK law.

  **1.3 Data subject**
  A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by Park Holidays UK.

  **1.4 Personal data**
  Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

  **1.5 Processing**
  Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

  **1.6 Processor**
  A Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. Park Holidays UK use partners and third party providers to act as processors on our behalf.

  **1.7 Profiling**
  Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.

  **1.8 Anonymisation**
  Anonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately in a secure database.

  **1.9 Recipient**
  A recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data is disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with the European Union or UK law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of such data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.

  **1.10 Restriction of processing**
  Restriction of processing is the highlighting of stored personal data so that no further processing of that data by Park Holidays UK or data processors is undertaken in the future.

  **1.11 Third party**
  A third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

**4. Cookies**

  Park Holidays UK websites use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer system via an internet browser.

  Many internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

  Through the use of cookies, Park Holidays UK can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the use of cookies.

  By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. A website user that uses cookies does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a data subject has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

  Our data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of their Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.

  If a data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be usable.

  If you require any further information on cookies including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage, delete and turn them off visit [https://www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org) or [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org). Please note these are external websites and Park Holidays UK is not responsible for the accuracy of the information on these sites.

  Park Holidays UK Ltd make use of both first party cookies and cookies from carefully selected third- parties, primarily for analytical, tracking and remarketing purposes. All our cookies are anonymous, containing no personally identifiable information. Please see the table below for a detailed breakdown of the cookies used by Park Holidays UK Ltd.

  If you decide to share our content using social media sharing tools on our Sites, you may be presented with cookies from third party sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Park Holidays UK does not control how these sites use cookies, therefore you should refer to the appropriate site's own privacy and cookie policy to understand how they use cookies.

  All cookies have an owner which tells you who the cookie belongs to. The owner is the domain specified in the cookie. In “third-party cookie”, the word “party” refers to the domain as specified in the cookie; the website that is placing the cookie. So, for example, if you visit widgets.com and the domain of the cookie placed on your computer is widgets.com, then this is a first-party cookie. If, however, you visit widgets.com and the cookie placed on your computer says stats-for-free.com, then this is a third-party cookie.

**5. Collection of general data and information**

  Park Holidays UK website collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system accesses the website. This general data and information is stored in the server log files. General data collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.

  When using such general data and information, Park Holidays UK does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, Park Holidays UK analyses anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our company, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

**6. Registration on our website**

  Our data subjects can register on our website and submit data which is collected and stored and may be shared with one or more processors (e.g. a brochure fulfilment service) that also uses the data subject’s personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.

  When you visit our website, our web server logs your IP address. This gives us information such as which pages you looked at, whether the page request was successful or not and which browser you use to view the page. The use of this data is purely for statistical purposes and to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offences internally or if we are required by law to do so.

  The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary submission of personal data, is intended to enable Park Holidays UK to offer the data subject content or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.

  Data subjects that complete enquiry forms, competition entries or other forms on the Park Holidays UK website will receive a minimum of 1 communication either by telephone, e-mail, SMS or post to acknowledge the data subject’s request and/or competition entry. At this time, the data subject will be asked to confirm their marketing preferences.

Park Holidays UK informs its data subject regularly by means of an electronic communication about news and events that may be of interest to data subjects.

A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such communications, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, Park Holidays UK may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by the data subject.

  Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the electronic communications are stored and analysed by Park Holidays UK to optimize the sending of the electronic communication, as well as to tailor the content of future electronic communications even better to the interests of the data subject. After a deletion request is received, this personal data will be deleted by Park Holidays UK.

  If Park Holidays UK processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.

**13. Legal basis for the processing**

  Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
  This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and their name, age, health data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the above mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator who considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

---

**14. Period for which the personal data will be stored**

  There are no specific minimum or maximum periods for retaining personal data. Instead, Park Holidays UK only retain personal data for the duration of the processing required thereafter this personal data is routinely deleted.

---

**15. Provision of personal data as a statutory or a contractual requirement;**

  When Park Holidays UK need to process someone’s personal data because we need to fulfil our contractual obligations to them or because they have asked us to do something before entering into a contract (e.g. pay for goods or services).

  There is an obligation on the data subject to provide us with personal data when we sign a contract with them however if the data subject elects to withhold their personal data then the contract would not be concluded.

---

**16. Existence of automated decision-making**

  Our financial third-party data processors do operate automatic decision-making or profiling practises.
