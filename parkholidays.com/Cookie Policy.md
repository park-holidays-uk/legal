## Cookies

  Park Holidays UK websites use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer system via an internet browser.

  Many internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

  Through the use of cookies, Park Holidays UK can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the use of cookies.

  By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. A website user that uses cookies does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a data subject has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

  Our data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of their Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.

  If a data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be usable.

  If you require any further information on cookies including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage, delete and turn them off visit [https://www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org) or [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

  Park Holidays UK Ltd make use of both first party cookies and cookies from carefully selected third- parties, primarily for analytical, tracking and remarketing purposes. All our cookies are anonymous, containing no personally identifiable information. Please see the table below for a detailed breakdown of the cookies used by Park Holidays UK Ltd.

  If you decide to share our content using social media sharing tools on our Sites, you may be presented with cookies from third party sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Park Holidays UK does not control how these sites use cookies, therefore you should refer to the appropriate site's own privacy and cookie policy to understand how they use cookies.

  All cookies have an owner which tells you who the cookie belongs to. The owner is the domain specified in the cookie. In “third-party cookie”, the word “party” refers to the domain as specified in the cookie; the website that is placing the cookie. So, for example, if you visit widgets.com and the domain of the cookie placed on your computer is widgets.com, then this is a first-party cookie. If, however, you visit widgets.com and the cookie placed on your computer says stats-for-free.com, then this is a third-party cookie.
